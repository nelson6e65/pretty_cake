(1/2)\r\n    [1] >\r\n\r\nThen, choose `pretty_cake` (`1` in this example) and press Enter to continue. :satisfied:\r\n\r\n#####Note:\r\n*If you changed the default theme name* (`pretty_cake`), you must run `$ .\\Console\\cake bake -t \"{theme_name}\"`  command instead (or select `{theme_name}` when bake ask you), where `{theme_name}` means your personalized name :wink:.\r\n\r\nExample: For `bootstrap` theme name, you should run instead:\r\n\r\n    $ .\\Console\\cake bake -t \"bootstrap\"\r\n\r\n## Instructions FAQ\r\n\r\n**What means `path/to/cakephp/app`?**\r\n> [See below].\r\n\r\n**What means `app directory`?**\r\n> Is de root path of your application. That is, by default, the **app** subdirectory of your CakePHP installation directory.\r\n> \r\nFor example, using wamp on Windows, *app directory* should be `C:\\wamp\\www\\cakephp\\app\\` (if you installed CakePHP in `C:\\wamp\\www\\cakephp\\`).\r\n> For further info, check [CakePHP Folder Structure](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/getting-started/cakephp-folder-structure.html#the-app-folder).\r\n\r\n**Where are located console themes?**\r\n> Console themes are placed inside your `app / Console / Templates /` directory:\r\n> \r\n`path/to/cakephp/app/Console/Templates/{here}`\r\n> For further info, check [CakePHP Folder Structure](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/getting-started/cakephp-folder-structure.html#the-app-folder).\r\n\r\n**Where should be located this theme?**\r\n> As I said in install instructions, content of this theme *must* be located inside templates directory: `app / Console / Templates / {theme_name} /`.\r\nThe default `{theme_name}` is `pretty_cake`:\r\n>\r\n`path/to/cakephp/app/Console/Templates/pretty_cake/`\r\n\r\n**What is Git submodule?**\r\n> Is a Git tool to treat the two projects as separate yet still be able to use one from within the other.
